## Meet Swift
Swift is a general-purpose programming language that’s approachable for newcomers and powerful for experts. It’s used to develop everything from apps and system software to cloud services and embedded firmware, and runs on a variety of platforms including macOS, Linux, and Windows.

🚧 **Pardon Our Dust** 🚧

While it may seem a bit empty at the moment, we are in the process of transferring repositories from their current locations. This staged migration helps minimize potential disruptions. For more information, check out our forum post that will go live later today.
